# Ford GoBike Bike Sharing Data Exploration & Visualization
## by James Idowu
This was the third project in the Udacity's data analyst certificate course


## Dataset

This dataset consists of information about individual rides made in the month of Febuary 2019 by Ford GoBike (Currently named Bay Wheels). 

This dataset has 183,412 observations(entries) across 16 features(columns). 


## Summary of Findings

In this exploration, I discovered that there is a strong relationship between age and subscription to the service. The service appears to be very popular amongst people within the ages of 20 to 60 years,with most of the users using the service at mornings followed by at night.

From the data exploration, it also appears a huge segment of the users generally use the service for short durations and a vast majority of it's users are males.




## Key Insights for Presentation

For my presentation, I focus on who are the main users of the service.
I start by introducing the user type variable and showing how it is distributed amongst its users. I also drill into the ages of the users, how long they rent the bikes for and what times of the day they generally use the service the most.

Following that, I showed the relationship between the ages of the users and the periods of the day they rented and return the bikes using a violin plot.

Finally I showed the relationship between three variables,namely: User type, rent duration and gender using a grouped barchart so that the relationship can be easily understood.
